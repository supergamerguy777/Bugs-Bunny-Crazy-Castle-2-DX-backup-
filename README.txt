Welcome! This is a backup for the "Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle DX" project. 
The download was recently removed from romhacking.net, so I figured I would make 
a backup for anyone out there looking to apply this wonderful project to their copy
of Crazy Castle 2 for the Gameboy. I hope you enjoy!

CREDITS: I will attribute the Fluffy Repair Service patch to "minucce", as that's 
who is credited on RHDN, though I want to offer a huge "Thank You!" to whoever 
developed that patch. The original hack was attributed to "FroggestSpirit", so 
thank you to that author as well!

PATCHING INFORMATION:
- Apply the base DX hack first, then the Fluffy Repair Service hack.
